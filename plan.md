Creating a level editor for an N64 project on a Chromebook involves organizing your project's files and components efficiently. Here's a basic file structure to get you started:

1. **Project Folder**
   - Create a main folder for your project.

2. **HTML File**
   - Index.html: This is the main web page for your level editor. It will include your editor's interface and display the game world.

3. **CSS Styles**
   - Styles.css: Manage the styling of your level editor and interface.

4. **JavaScript Files**
   - Main.js: The core logic for your level editor, including the functions for adding and editing elements.
   - Background.js: Implement the background editor features.
   - Blocks.js: Code for creating and managing blocks in your game.
   - Actors.js: Logic for handling enemies and actors.
   - Zoom.js: Implement zoom in and zoom out features.
   - Performance.js: Optimize your editor for less lag.

5. **Images and Assets**
   - Store images, textures, and other assets that you'll use in your level editor and the N64 game.

6. **Libraries**
   - If you use any third-party libraries, keep them in a separate folder.

7. **Documentation**
   - Create a documentation folder for tutorials, guides, and explanations.

8. **Testing**
   - Develop a separate folder for testing files and scripts.

Remember to organize your code into functions and classes, making it modular and easy to maintain. Each file should have a specific role to keep your project organized and understandable.

This structure can serve as a starting point for your project. As you work on your level editor for the N64 project, you can adapt and expand it according to your specific needs.
